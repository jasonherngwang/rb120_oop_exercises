The code below raises an exception. Examine the error message and alter the 
code so that it runs without error.

Songbird's constructor uses `super` to pass 3 arguments to the inherited 
constructor from Animal, which only takes 2 parameters. Change Songbird's 
`super` method invocation to only pass `diet` and `superpower`.
